## Installation & Setup

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GDSC-Bingo.git
cd GDSC-Bingo
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the Backend directory:
```bash
cd Backend
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the Frontend directory:
```bash
cd Frontend
```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables (optional):
```bash
# The .env file is already configured for local development
# For production, copy .env.production and update the URLs
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Session Persistence

The application now maintains user sessions across page refreshes using localStorage. Players won't lose their progress if they accidentally refresh the page or navigate away.
